## Design Decision & Challenge

1. Faced a design limitation while implementing the "Recent Payment" section on the payment page, as most of the screen space was already occupied.
   Solution: Introduced a tab layout to group User Contacts and Recent Transactions together.

2. Initial implementation only included a Payment Page and a Confirmation Page as per requirements. However, this made the app appear unpolished and lacking in content.
   Solution: Designed and added a Home Page (UI inspired by Touch 'n Go) along with a Transaction History section to enhance overall appearance and functionality.

3. Grammar inconsistencies in labels and text affected the appâ€™s professional look.
   Solution: Improved all text and labels using AI tools to ensure proper grammar and consistency.

## Potential New Feature

1.  Internationalisation / Translation: Implement multiple language support using the i18n library to cater to diverse users.

2.  Theme Switcher: Add a feature to toggle between Light Mode and Dark Mode for better user experience and accessibility.
